Joint Platforms
---------------

* * *

The five STCC joint platforms function as an integrative whole to drive pertinent transformative cancer Research &amp; Translation (R&amp;T) themes and deliver high-impact healthcare and economic outcomes.

The joint platforms enable collaboration between basic, clinical and translational researchers to explore novel approaches, push promising lines of research and translation, and seed ideas for larger competitive translational grants.

In Phase 2, STCC aims to:

*   Further develop, integrate and expand the national-scale enabling infrastructure established in the current phase (STCC Phase 1); and establish new, unique and scalable national translational cancer research resources and capabilities;
*   Develop research translational peaks in selected areas.
