<p>The STCC is a nationally coordinated, virtual organisation set up in 2020,
under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 Plan, to address
the need for a cohesive and collaborative national level cancer Research
&amp; Translation (R&amp;T) platform. It aims to synergise cancer research
capabilities, and raise Singapore’s overall prominence, competitiveness
and healthcare impact regionally and globally, in selected cancers. It
was registered as a business unit under the Consortium for Clinical Research
and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS) in April 2020.</p>
<h4>Phase 1</h4>
<p>In STCC Phase 1,&nbsp;the foundational framework for a national level
R&amp;T programme comprising four joint platforms was established to bring
together top basic, clinical and translational talent and expertise in
the cancer research ecosystem. A central coordinating office (Strategic
Planning and Development office) was also set up to manage daily operations
and resource management, drive and track deliverables, and support the
STCC leadership in running the consortium.</p>
<h4>Phase 2</h4>
<p>STCC Phase 2 will be a continued effort from Phase 1 to further develop
and augment the cancer R&amp;T infrastructure, and drive cohesiveness in
the research community. STCC aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Accelerate, scale-up, strengthen the quality and value creation for strategic
research by promoting research integration and developing enabling framework,
resources and capabilities at the national level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actively develop, shape and grow peaks of research translational excellence
that are globally competitive and hold potential in transforming cancer
healthcare and creating economic value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>STCC Phase 2 will follow these key operating principles:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>STCC will be a single front door to researchers, government and industry.
Our backend engine will help them enhance their research and simplify collaborations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>STCC aims to serve a dual function of building national cancer resources
and driving national research initiatives and cooperative multi-centre
studies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>STCC’s strategies and focus areas are aligned with Human Health and Potential
(HHP) RIE2025 strategies in the areas of precision medicine, early detection,
value-based healthcare, therapeutics and diagnostics, talent, data, research
excellence, I&amp;E ecosystem and healthcare translation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
