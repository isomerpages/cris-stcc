<p>The Cancer Databases and Tissue Banks Platform aims to drive innovation
and collaboration by providing centralised and secure access to high-quality
cancer specimens and multi-modal data to accelerate high-impact translational
cancer research discoveries that lead to improved patient outcomes in Singapore.
Our platform is anchored by the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS),
Singapore Health Services, National University Health System (NUHS), and
Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).</p>
<h4><strong>About the STCC Data Resource</strong></h4>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Adhere to international standards and certification</strong>
</p>
<p>Our partner tissue repositories have received the Canadian Tissue Repository
Network (CTRNet) certification and are aligned with the International Society
for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER) biobanking standards.
Our repositories also adhere to frameworks like the 5 Safes Framework for
secure data access, OMOP clinical data standards for interoperability,
and GA4GH genomic data standards for responsible sharing of genomic information.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Robust governance framework</strong>
</p>
<p>User access is governed by a robust framework that complies with the Personal
Data Protection Act (PDPA), Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA), Human
Tissue Framework (HTF) and HealthTech Instruction Manual - Data Management
(HIM-DM), ensuring patient data privacy, protection, and security.</p>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;Our Capabilities</strong></h4>

<p></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>STCC Research Warehouse</strong>
</p>
<p>The STCC Research Warehouse is a centralised data repository that houses
the STCC Cancer Data Commons (CDC), with linkages to specimen and molecular
data. The CDC consists of de-identified data from the cancer registry.
This platform is developed in partnership with SYNAPXE and adheres to rigorous
data governance and security protocols. The platform employs federated
analytics and privacy-preserving technologies, enabling secure local and
international research collaborations.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>STCC Cancer Data Commons</strong>  <strong>(CDC)</strong>
</p>
<p>Housed in the STCC Research Warehouse, the STCC CDC is a centralised data
resource of oncology clinical records from the three healthcare clusters,
NCCS, NUHS and NHG, between 2011 to 2021. This is securely linked to corresponding
biospecimen and multi-omic datasets, offering unparalleled opportunities
for in-depth translational cancer research.</p>
<p>On-platform data analyses can be performed on the:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>STCC CDC:</strong> Supports direct
analyses of data in the STCC CDC. Access to the STCC CDC is governed by
the STCC Specimen and Data Access Committee (SDAC).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>STCC Research Data Hub (RDH):</strong> Supports
analyses of data in the STCC CDC linked with multi-modal research data.
Access to the STCC RDH is governed by the STCC SDAC.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>MOH TRUST:</strong> Supports analyses
of data in the STCC CDC linked with data in the MOH TRUST database. Data
access to the MOH TRUST platform is subject to approval from the TRUST
Data Access Committee (DAC).</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Bio Repositories Catalogue</strong>
</p>
<p>A publicly accessible, comprehensive listing of high-quality oncology
biospecimens from tissue repositories at NCCS, NUHS, TTSH, and the Singapore
Network of Biorepositories (SINB) hosted on the Clinical Trials Singapore

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>STCC Centralised Catalogue</strong>
</p>
<p>A centralised listing of specimens with 127 annotated data fields, such
as tumour types, patient demographics, and treatment histories, from tissue
repositories and cancer registries at NCCS, NUHS, TTSH, for public healthcare
institutional users. It streamlines cohort selection and study design,
accelerating the translation of research findings into clinical applications.</p>
<p>The STCC Centralised Catalogue can be accessed<strong> </strong><a href="https://nuhgspcvpapp01/#/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;(requires
institutional login).</p>
<p></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>STCC Research Data Hub</strong> (RDH;
estimated go-live in 2026)</p>
<p>The RDH is a molecular and omics data repository and analytics platform
developed in partnership with the STCC <a href="https://www.stcc.sg/platform-3/translational-research-integration-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Translational Research Integration and Support platform</a> and
the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) Bioinformatics
Institute (BII). The RDH houses molecular data generated by STCC research
projects and STCC research partners.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Initiatives</strong></h4>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>STCC OneCANCER</strong>
</p>
<p>The STCC OneCANCER initiative fosters collaborations among cancer research
groups across Singapore, by facilitating access to biospecimens and data
generated from diverse research projects. Data from our partnering research
groups, including the Singapore Lymphoma Study, TETRAD, Singapore Gastric
Cancer Consortium, will be housed in the STCC Cancer Data Commons and the
Research Data Hub.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>STCC Australasian Cancer Alliance (ACA)</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The ACA initiative aims to foster cross-border translational cancer
research by streamlining access to cancer biospecimens and associated data
across leading cancer biorepositories within the Australasian region. Our
partners include the <a href="https://viccancerbiobank.org.au/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Victorian Cancer Biobank</a>&nbsp;in
Australia and the <a href="https://www.nhri.edu.tw/eng/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Health Research Institutes</a> in
Taiwan. We are actively seeking to expand our partner network and welcome
interested parties to <a href="https://form.gov.sg/64af78bb7075fe00114ad913" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>
