<p>The&nbsp;Cancer Database and Tissue Banks Platform combines existing databases of the Singhealth and National University Health System Tissue Repositories (NUHS TR)&nbsp;and is aligned with the&nbsp;Singapore Network of Biorepositories&nbsp;(SINB), which catalogues specimens and data of other disease types. This will serve as a common national-level resource platform that supports investigators’ queries by providing access to different data including specimen type, clinically annotated data and OMICS data.</p><p>The platform will have a governance framework that ensures patient data privacy, protection and security and will support access to high quality clinical samples and associated data in a safe, efficient and ethical manner.</p><p>Both Singhealth and NUHS TRs are certified through the&nbsp;Canadian Tissue Repository Network&nbsp;(CTRNet), an international biobanking certification program, and comply with Singapore’s&nbsp;Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA). The standard operating procedures are aligned with the best practices of the&nbsp;International Society For Biological and Environmental Repositories&nbsp;(ISBER).</p>
