The Translational Research Integration & Support (TRIS) platform offers potential solutions to several healthcare challenges in oncology by improving patient stratification for standard and novel therapies. It is a national-level platform to bring together expertise from the Agency of Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR), and academic cancer researchers in Singapore, with the common goal of developing, testing and validating potential new biomarkers and molecular diagnostics. The platform serves as a coordinating hub for advanced molecular assays (including genomics, transcriptomics and spatial molecular profiling) on samples from patients enrolled in STCC clinical trials and clinical research studies.
