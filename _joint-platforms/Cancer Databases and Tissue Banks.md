The&nbsp;Cancer Database and Tissue Banks Platform combines existing databases of the Singhealth and National University Health System Tissue Repositories (NUHS TR)&nbsp;and is aligned with the&nbsp;Singapore Network of Biorepositories&nbsp;(SINB), which catalogues specimens and data of other disease types. This will serve as a common national-level resource platform that supports investigatorsâ€™ queries by providing access to different data including specimen type, clinically annotated data and OMICS data.
