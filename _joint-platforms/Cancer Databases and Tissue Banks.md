The Cancer Database and Tissue Banks Platform combines existing databases of the Singhealth and National University Health System Tissue Repositories (NUHS TR) and is aligned with the Singapore Network of Biorepositories (SINB), which catalogues specimens and data of other disease types. This will serve as a common national-level resource platform that supports investigators’ queries by providing access to different data including specimen type, clinically annotated data and OMICS data.
