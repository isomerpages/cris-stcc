The Translational Research Integration &amp; Support platform creates and delivers end-to-end solutions that supports multi-institutional translational and pre-clinical studies, from study design to outcomes. We bring together&nbsp;expertise&nbsp;from cancer research institutes and academic centres across Singapore, with the common goal of developing, testing and validating potential new biomarkers and molecular diagnostics. Our platform boasts a comprehensive facilitation pipeline for translational and pre-clinical research, and functions as a coordinating hub for molecular assays and ex vivo tumour models. This supports our mission to promote collaboration and cohesiveness among academia and industry players in the cancer research community.
