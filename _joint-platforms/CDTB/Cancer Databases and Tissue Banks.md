Cancer Databases and Tissue Banks
---------------------------------

The Cancer Database and Tissue Banks Platform combines existing databases of the Singhealth and National University Health System Tissue Repositories (NUHS TR) and is aligned with the Singapore Network of Biorepositories (SINB), which catalogues specimens and data of other disease types. This will serve as a common national-level resource platform that supports investigators’ queries by providing access to different data including specimen type, clinically annotated data and OMICS data.

The platform will have a governance framework that ensures patient data privacy, protection and security and will support access to high quality clinical samples and associated data in a safe, efficient and ethical manner. 

Both Singhealth and NUHS TRs are certified through the Canadian Tissue Repository Network (CTRNet), an international biobanking certification program, and comply with Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA). The standard operating procedures are aligned with the best practices of the International Society For Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER).
