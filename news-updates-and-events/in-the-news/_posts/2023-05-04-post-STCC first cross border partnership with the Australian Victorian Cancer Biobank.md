Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium (STCC) has signed its first cross-border partnership with the Australian Victorian Cancer Biobank (VCB) to foster collaborations in translational oncology research.  

As part of the partnership agreement, STCC and VCB will share its oncology specimen databases, allowing researchers to access a wider array of tissue samples for cancer research.

Both organisations will also share tissue banking best practices, and establish outreach programmes to advance clinical research collaborations between the two countries.
