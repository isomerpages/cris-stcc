<p>Professor Lim Soon Thye, who is Co-Director of STCC will complete his
term of office on 30 October 2024. Prof Lim Soon Thye has been STCC’s Co-Director
since November 2019. Together with Prof Chng Wee Joo, Executive Director,

of four joint platforms and spearheaded initiatives aimed at streamlining
workflows across institutions, and at optimising resources and expertise,
making them more accessible to researchers.</p>
<p>Specifically, under his stewardship, STCC has established noteworthy partnerships
including collaborations with esteemed institution such as the Victorian
Cancer Biobank in Australia, industry giant Roche, and the national platform
