<p>Singapore’s cancer screening gap is widening – at a time when the consequences
of inaction are becoming harder to ignore. In his latest commentary, <strong>Prof Ravindran Kanesvaran</strong> highlights
a worrying disconnect and calls for urgent action: despite national screening
programmes, participation rates remain low, even as cancer diagnoses rise
sharply among younger adults.</p>
<p>Early detection has never been more critical. Yet barriers persist - from
fear of diagnosis, cultural stigma, misconceptions, cost concerns, discomfort
with procedures and competing life priorities Prof Kanesvaran proposes
a shift towards more tailored outreach and population-based approaches,
drawing lessons from industry peers in Australia, the United Kingdom, etc.</p>
<p>He also outlines Singapore’s ongoing efforts, including the launch of
Research Institute for Cancer Prevention, Screening and Early Detection
(RISE) and close partnership with partners such as <strong>STCC</strong> to
drive evidence-based policy recommendations and implementation strategies
for cancer screening and early detective initiatives in Singapore.</p>
<p>“Singapore’s cancer screening challenge requires a coordinated response
that reflects changing disease patterns. Implementing systematic approaches,
continuing to invest in research and learning from international best practices
is the way forward.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Prof Ravindran is the Co-Director, STCC.</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Through his role, STCC is fostering cross-border partnerships in biobanking and translational cancer research, aligned with key thrusts of RIE2030 strategies, one of which aims to fundamentally transform population health and healthcare, moving beyond treating illness to keeping people healthy for longer through early detection, prevention and targeted interventions.</em>
