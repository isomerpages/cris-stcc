<h4><strong>STCC and National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) embark on research collaboration to advance an organ-on-chip platform leveraging Philips’ technology</strong></h4>
<p>In December, STCC and NCCS announced a research collaboration that will
advance an Organ-on-Chip (OoC) platform leveraging Philips’ technology.
OoCs are systems containing tissues that grow inside microfluidic chips
which are able to mimic human physiology. The aim of the collaboration
is to develop an OoC platform to enhance in-vitro pre-clinical cancer research
in Singapore.</p>
<p>The OoC platform, to be developed together with the Philips technology
licencing team, will generate tumour organoid models at scale and enable
high-throughput approaches, increasing the potential to accelerate cancer
research and enable researchers to develop more effective and targeted
cancer treatments. This initiative will further support STCC’s objectives
to be a one-stop centre for academics and industry players to come together,
collaborate and utilise ex-vivo tumour models for biomarker identification,
validation, and drug candidate discovery.</p>
