<p>Report on Singapore’s efforts to advance cancer care by training healthcare
staff overseas and studying cell therapies. Dr Ravindran Kanesvaran from
NCCS highlighted a sharp rise in cancer among those aged 50 and below,
prompting tailored programmes for seniors and a push to improve access
to costly emerging treatments through multi-sector collaboration.</p>
<p>He also highlighted a 90% increase in cancer cases among those aged 50
and below from 1988–1992 to 2018–2022, with a 112% increase among females.
He attributed the trend to lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors,
noting that many causes remain unclear.</p>
