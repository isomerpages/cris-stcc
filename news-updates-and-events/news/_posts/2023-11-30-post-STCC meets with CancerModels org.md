<h4><strong>STCC meets with <a href="http://CancerModels.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CancerModels.org</a></strong></h4>
<p>In November 2023, the STCC team was thrilled to meet with <a href="https://www.cancermodels.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>CancerModels.Org</u></a> to
learn about the meaningful work which the organisation does to build an
open-source and community-driven resource which standardises, integrates
and publishes the complex and diverse data associated with patient-derived
cancer xenografts, organoids and cell lines.</p>

</p>
<p>This initiative enables researchers and institutions from around the world
to find and access patient derived cancer models, contribute to a shared
knowledge pool, accelerate cancer research, and develop personalised cancer
treatments.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.cancermodels.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CancerModels.org</a> begins
their next phase of development in Singapore and the APAC region, STCC
looks forward to embarking on a meaningful partnership with them.</p>
