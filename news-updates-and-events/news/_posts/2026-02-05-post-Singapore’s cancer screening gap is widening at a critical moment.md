<hr>
<p>Singapore’s cancer screening gap is widening – at a time when the consequences
of inaction are becoming harder to ignore. In his latest commentary, <strong>Prof Ravindran Kanesvaran</strong> highlights
a worrying disconnect and calls for urgent action: despite national screening
programmes, participation rates remain low, even as cancer diagnoses rise
sharply among younger adults.</p>
