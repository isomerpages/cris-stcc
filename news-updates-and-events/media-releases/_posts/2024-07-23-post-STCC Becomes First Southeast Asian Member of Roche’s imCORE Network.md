<h3><strong>The Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium (STCC) Becomes First Southeast Asian Member of Roche’s imCORE Network of Leading Global Research Centres to Advance Understanding of Cancer Immunotherapy</strong><br><br></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>STCC is the first Southeast Asian member in the prestigious immunotherapy
Centers Of Research Excellence (imCORE) Network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>STCC is also imCORE’s first consortium member, leading a coalition of
Singapore’s public healthcare and research institutions in the translational
cancer research ecosystem, comprising the National Cancer Centre Singapore
(NCCS), National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS), National
University Hospital (NUH), National University of Singapore (NUS) and Tan
Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The STCC-imCORE partnership aims to bolster Singapore’s drive to become
a global leader in cancer immunotherapy (CIT) research and catalyse local
access to innovative treatments through collaborative clinical studies.</p>

<br><strong>SINGAPORE, 24 July, 2024</strong> – STCC is proud to announce its
participation in the Roche/Genentech-led, immunotherapy Centers Of Research
Excellence (imCORE) Network, a global initiative aiming to advance CIT.
STCC is the 27th member of the imCORE Network, the first from Southeast
Asia and the first consortium to join. STCC enters this prestigious Network
leading a coalition of Singapore’s public healthcare and research institutions
in the translational cancer research ecosystem: National Cancer Centre
Singapore (NCCS), National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS),
National University Hospital (NUH), National University of Singapore (NUS)
and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).</p>
<p>imCORE’s vision is to advance and extend the most promising new cancer
immunotherapy treatment options for cancer patients. The imCORE Network
unites both clinical and basic scientific experts from leading cancer research
institutions worldwide alongside Roche and Genentech, in an open environment
to collaborate on research, share information, expertise and technologies.
imCORE has already achieved significant breakthroughs. Notably, the Network
played a critical role in accelerating the development of a pancreatic
cancer vaccine candidate that is currently in a Phase II trial (<a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05968326" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>NCT05968326</u></a>).</p>
<p>STCC’s participation in imCORE will catalyse and boost scientific exchange
and collaborations across the full spectrum of CIT research. This includes
pre-clinical, translational and real-world data (RWD) studies to solve
cancer immunotherapy challenges, improve understanding of the tumour microenvironment
in Asian populations, and accelerate the search for innovative cancer treatments.</p>
<p>It is a significant step towards STCC’s vision to establish Singapore
as a cancer clinical trial hub and a global leader in translational cancer
research, especially for cancers with higher prevalence or unique characteristics
in Asian populations such as gastric cancer, head &amp; neck cancer, lung
cancer, liver cancer, clear cell ovarian carcinoma and Natural killer/T-cell
lymphomas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professor Chng Wee Joo, Executive Director, STCC, said, “The STCC-imCORE
partnership is a significant milestone for Singapore’s cancer immunotherapy
research community, and represents a unique opportunity to collaborate
with the brightest minds in the field of cancer immunotherapy globally.
Together with Roche, Genentech and imCORE, we hope to pioneer novel immunotherapeutic
strategies that can address current unmet medical needs for patients in
Singapore, and globally, demonstrate our commitment to scientific excellence
and patient-centric innovation.”</p>
<p>Jacqueline Karmel, Chair, imCORE Executive Office, Roche, said, "Singapore
is renowned for its scientific expertise, high-impact research, and world-class
healthcare infrastructure. With STCC and its partner institutions now part
of imCORE, our network is even stronger. We are thrilled about STCC’s co-creative
spirit and excited to work together to make a meaningful impact on CIT
research and bring the vision of imCORE to life for patients, both in Singapore
and around the world.”</p>
<p>At the launch ceremony, ACTRIS also announced a joint grant call with
the National Health Innovation Centre Singapore (NHIC) to accelerate the
adoption of cell therapies in our local hospitals to enhance healthcare
delivery and patient care. Eligible projects will receive funding and support
to foster the development of cell therapy products.</p>
