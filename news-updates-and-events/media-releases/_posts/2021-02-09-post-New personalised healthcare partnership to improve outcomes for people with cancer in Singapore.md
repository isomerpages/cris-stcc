**SINGAPORE, 9 February 2021:** Today, the Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium (STCC), National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS), the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) at the National University Hospital (NUH) and Roche announced a unique and groundbreaking partnership between public and private sector institutions in Singapore aimed at establishing a critical infrastructure to advance the adoption of personalised healthcare in Singapore. Personalised healthcare, which includes precision oncology or personalised cancer care, leverages insights from medical and genomic data to help make more precise treatment decisions for each individual based on their clinical profile.

**Building a Foundation for Future Care**  
As part of the three-year partnership, the STCC, NCCS and NCIS will offer their medical expertise, research insight and data resources to build a clinico-genomic database (CGDB) in Singapore that combines clinical insights and real-world evidence – anonymised data from patients’ responses to medicine and care – with the goal of yielding better patient outcomes. STCC will lead the establishment of a national precision oncology infrastructure for information sharing around comprehensive genomic profiling, molecular tumour boards and outcomes tracking.

“Singapore’s population is ageing and faces a rising incidence of chronic diseases, including cancer. As part of the effort to address this, Singapore has in place various initiatives to advance personalised healthcare in the local healthcare and research community,” said Professor Chng Wee Joo, Executive Director of STCC and Director of NCIS. “This MOU extends this effort in oncology and paves the way towards a data-driven and patient-centric model that would transform healthcare delivery while providing value-based solutions.”

“STCC will embark on the path to develop a precision oncology care model in Singapore and promote institutional-industry collaborations,” said Professor Lim Soon Thye, Co-Executive Director of STCC, Deputy Group Chairman Medical Board at SingHealth and Deputy Medical Director (Clinical) at NCCS. “Together, we will work towards shaping clinical guidelines and healthcare policies based on high quality real-world data that addresses the challenges of growing healthcare demands in Singapore.”

NCCS and NCIS will tap their institutions’ networks of clinical and scientific experts and existing cross-institutional programmes like the SInGapore ImmuNogrAm for Immuno-OncoLogy (SIGNAL) and the Cancer Liquid Biopsies for Real-time diagnostics and early intervention (CaLiBRe) platforms, to expand genomic testing, identify optimal therapeutic strategies for patients and co-develop guidelines for precision oncology and patient access while providing resources to build the personalised healthcare ecosystem.

“In some cancers, comprehensive molecular profiling may enable the most precise treatment to be tailored based on the genetic profiles of patients’ tumours. With advances in diagnostics and treatment, this benefit is expected to expand to even more patients,” said Dr Iain Tan, Senior Consultant Medical Oncologist, NCCS. “This collaboration brings together leaders in cancer care, molecular profiling and data analytics that will further enhance Singapore’s capacity to deliver cutting-edge personalised cancer care and ultimately benefit more patients.”

“The ability to identify and target specific molecular abnormalities in tumours with medicines has transformed cancer management, improved patient outcomes, and led to accelerated advances in cancer therapy. As comprehensive molecular profiling of tumours becomes increasingly routine in cancer care, precision oncology is no longer a pipe dream,” said Associate Professor David Tan, Senior Consultant, Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) and Head, Innovation Transfer Office (Research Office) at the National University Health System. “This collaboration will help expand access to molecular profiling for our cancer patients, which will in turn enable us to identify the best available treatment options, including clinical trials, for them. We envisage that the results of this project will help us assess the impact of molecular profiling on patient outcomes, and determine the role of comprehensive tumour molecular profiling as a standard of care for future generations of cancer patients in Singapore.”

With genomic profiling of their tumour, a person may have more options to receive personalised care that treats the underlying molecular driver of their disease. Over the past five years, Foundation Medicine (FMI), a molecular information company that is part of the Roche Group, has been providing comprehensive genomic profiling in Singapore to support physicians and patients in these cancer care decisions. To support the application of precision oncology, Roche will provide access to comprehensive genomic profiling by FMI. They will also advise on the design and implementation of the Singapore CGDB based on FMI and Flatiron Health’s CGDB with more than 400,000 patient profiles, which has been used to identify new targets for development of medicines and companion diagnostic tests.

“Insights gained from the collection of high-quality, standardised genomic data in these databases can supplement or amplify clinical studies to help accelerate research and development, which we hope will ultimately optimise healthcare resources and increase chances of survival for even more people with cancer,” said Ryan Harper, General Manager of Roche Singapore. “We are honoured to collaborate with STCC, NCCS and NCIS to do more in the fight against cancer. Together, we can deliver solutions to advance the healthcare system of Singapore with the hope of helping even more people across the region in the future.”
