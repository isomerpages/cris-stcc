</div>
<p>On 24 July 2024, STCC was inaugurated into the immunotherapy Centers Of
Research Excellence (imCORE) Network, along with Roche and Genentech. As
a member of this prestigious global network, we will collaborate with leading
cancer research institutions to accelerate research on immuno-oncology
and advance the development of cancer immunotherapy (CIT) treatment for
patients. Among the 27 institutions in the network, STCC is the first from
Southeast Asia, and the first consortium to join, leading a coalition of
Singapore's public healthcare and research institutions in the cancer research
and translation ecosystem,</p>
<p>As part of this international expert network, STCC will now be able to
participate in global cancer trials, providing Singapore with greater access
to cutting-edge research and novel cancer drugs. This partnership not only
enhances collaboration, but also holds the potential to pioneer novel immunotherapeutic
strategies that can address current unmet medical needs for patients in
Singapore.</p>

<p>STCC launched its National Health Economics on Cancer project in June
2024, a collaborative effort that brings together experts from leading
institutions such as the Ministry of Health, National Cancer Centre Singapore,
National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, Tan Tock Seng Hospital,
and the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. This initiative aims
to provide a comprehensive assessment of the cancer landscape in Singapore,
focusing on key areas like cancer incidence, stage distribution, and mortality
rates, stratified by demographics.</p>
<p>By leveraging data-driven insights, the project aims to identify critical
areas within cancer care and prevention that require improvement. The goal
is to inform decision-making and support the development of evidence-based
policies that will enhance cancer outcomes for patients across Singapore.
Beyond analysis, the project seeks to advance cancer care and public health
initiatives in the region, contributing to more effective and patient-centred
healthcare solutions.</p>

<p>STCC signed a collaborative agreement with the Victorian Cancer Biobank
in May 2024 to bolster the biobanking and cancer research capabilities
of STCC and Victorian Cancer BioBank.</p>
<p>The partnership will establish a catalogue where authorised researchers
from Victoria and Singapore can co-list and co-access vital and anonymised
biospecimens for their cancer research projects. This partnership with
VCB expands access and diversity to this vital resource, ensuring that
research discoveries translate into real-world impact for our patients.</p>

<h4><strong><sub>In loving memory: Tribute to Dr Eng Chon Boon, Platform Lead for Cancer Databases &amp; Tissue Banks</sub></strong></h4>
<p>STCC is deeply saddened by the loss of Dr Eng Chon Boon, Platform Lead
for Cancer Databases &amp; Tissue Banks at STCC. A well-respected leader
and mentor in the scientific community, Dr Eng held special expertise in
biobanking and showed unwavering support for clinical researchers. His
dedication transformed STCC into a vital resource for cancer research and
translation, fostering collaboration both locally and internationally.</p>
<p>Dr Eng's guidance and astute leadership spearheaded impactful partnerships.
He was instrumental in forming the Singapore Integrated Network of Biobanks,
and he led STCC's first cross-border partnership with the Australian Victorian
Cancer Biobank, expanding access to tissue samples and promoting best practices
in translational oncology research across the region and beyond.</p>
<p>To further empower researchers, Dr Eng oversaw the development of the
STCC Research Warehouse, which provided researchers with a powerful suite
of tools to facilitate harmonised cancer research projects.</p>
<p>Dr Eng leaves behind a lasting legacy championing specimen and data accessibility
in cancer research. He will be dearly missed and fondly remembered.</p>

<p></p>
<p>As we look ahead to the new year, STCC will continue to expand its outreach
as a translational cancer research front door for researchers and the industry
and be the unifying catalyst for more high-impact partnerships and collaborative
cancer programmes.</p>
<p>With a significant and memorable year behind us, we look forward to the
boundless potential ahead, and another year filled with a renewed sense
of purpose. &nbsp;</p>
