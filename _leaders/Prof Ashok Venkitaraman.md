**Profile**&nbsp;

* * *

Professor Ashok&nbsp;Venkitaraman&nbsp;is the Director of the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, and a Distinguished Professor of Medicine at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, a member of the National University Health System (NUHS). He holds a joint appointment at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR).&nbsp;

Prof&nbsp;Venkitaraman’s&nbsp;research has contributed fundamentally to our understanding of how cancer is suppressed by genes that&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;the integrity of DNA in the human genome. His laboratory is recognized for the discovery that mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer gene, BRCA2, provoke genome instability leading to carcinogenesis. Prof&nbsp;Venkitaraman&nbsp;now&nbsp;seeks&nbsp;to achieve a deeper understanding of the steps that underlie carcinogenesis,&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;find new strategies to intercept cancer development well before the disease reaches an advanced and hard-to- treat stage. He has developed&nbsp;new technologies&nbsp;to target previously ‘undruggable’ targets, and is a serial biotech entrepreneur, most recently as a founder of&nbsp;PhoreMost&nbsp;Ltd.&nbsp;

Prof.&nbsp;Venkitaraman&nbsp;has been elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, London, and as a member of EMBO.
