**Profile**&nbsp;

* * *

Professor Wee Joo Chng has been appointed as the Executive Director of the Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium since 2019. He obtained his medical degree from the University of Leeds and did his internal medicine residency in the United Kingdom. He completed his fellowship training in haematology in Singapore before he obtained an A\*STAR international fellowship in 2004 to go to the Mayo Clinic for a research fellowship in multiple myeloma genetics.&nbsp;

Professor Chng is a member of many leading national and international professional committees, including the former President of the Singapore Society of Hematology, the International Myeloma Working Group and the Asian Myeloma Network. He is also involved in a number of grant review committees, conference organising committees, advisory boards and steering committees of global clinical trials. He actively participates in clinical trials, and has authored more than 300 publications in many reputed journals, as well as delivered numerous talks in major conferences and seminars. His impactful research has won him numerous national and global accolades including the NUHS Research Excellence Award, the International Myeloma Foundation’s Brian GM Durie Outstanding Achievement Award, the National Medical Excellence Outstanding Clinician Scientist Award, the National Medical Research Council Senior Translational Research (STaR) Award, the National University of Singapore Young Researcher Award, and the Celgene Future Leaders in Haematology Award.

Professor Chng’s research focuses on the use of global genomics methods (microarray and sequencing platforms) to study the clinical and biological heterogeneity in haematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma and lymphoma. Using these methods, he has identified novel prognostic markers and molecular abnormalities in these malignancies, serving as potential targets for therapy and providing insights into disease pathogenesis and biology. He has strong research interest in risk stratification and clinical trials in myeloma.
