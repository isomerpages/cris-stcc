<h5>Profile</h5>
<p><strong>Professor Chng Wee Joo</strong> has been appointed as the Executive
Director of the Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium since 2019. He
obtained his medical degree from the University of Leeds and did his internal
medicine residency in the United Kingdom. He completed his fellowship training
in haematology in Singapore before he obtained an A*STAR international
fellowship in 2004 to go to the Mayo Clinic for a research fellowship in
multiple myeloma genetics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professor Chng is a member of many leading national and international
professional committees, including the former President of the Singapore
Society of Hematology, the International Myeloma Working Group and the
Asian Myeloma Network. He is also involved in a number of grant review
committees, conference organising committees, advisory boards and steering
committees of global clinical trials. He actively participates in clinical
trials, and has authored more than 300 publications in many reputed journals,
as well as delivered numerous talks in major conferences and seminars.
His impactful research has won him numerous national and global accolades
including the NUHS Research Excellence Award, the International Myeloma
Foundation’s Brian GM Durie Outstanding Achievement Award, the National
Medical Excellence Outstanding Clinician Scientist Award, the National
Medical Research Council Senior Translational Research (STaR) Award, the
National University of Singapore Young Researcher Award, and the Celgene
Future Leaders in Haematology Award.</p>
<p>Professor Chng’s research focuses on the use of global genomics methods
(microarray and sequencing platforms) to study the clinical and biological
heterogeneity in haematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia,
multiple myeloma and lymphoma. Using these methods, he has identified novel
prognostic markers and molecular abnormalities in these malignancies, serving
as potential targets for therapy and providing insights into disease pathogenesis
and biology. He has strong research interest in risk stratification and
clinical trials in myeloma.</p>
