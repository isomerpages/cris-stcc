<h5>Profile</h5>
<p><strong>Associate Professor Tan Ern Yu</strong> is a senior consultant
and breast surgeon at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). She is also the Director
of Clinical Research, Head of the Breast Service, and Director of the Breast
Clinic. She completed her Doctor of Philosophy studies at the University
of Oxford in 2005.</p>
<p>Dr Tan is actively engaged in research focused on translatable clinical
outcomes. Her extensive research endeavors have involved collaborations
with various esteemed local and international institutes such as the Institute
of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB) where she has a joint appointment,
as well as the Genome Institute of Singapore, Lee Kong Chian School of
Medicine, National Cancer Center Tokyo, Cleveland Clinic, and several other
international units through the Singapore Breast Cancer Working Group.</p>
<p>Dr Tan’s primary research interest lies in biomarker discovery, with a
focus on blood-based DNA and microRNA markers that could serve as potential
cancer markers. One notable collaboration involves working with IMCB and
Indivumed to establish the world’s pioneering Asian-centric multi-omics
database. Complementing her research pursuits, she actively explores advancements
in breast imaging alongside breast radiologists. These collaborative efforts
aim to optimize the use of breast imaging in diagnosing and managing various
breast conditions. Notably, they are engaged in ongoing projects centered
around contrast-enhanced spectral mammography and the development and training
of artificial intelligence algorithms for mammography and breast ultrasound.
These initiatives are conducted in partnership with industry experts.&nbsp;Dr.
Tan is enthusiastic about expanding these research endeavors to support
the broader research community in her capacity as the Director of Clinical
Research at TTSH. She is leading the efforts to set up data and imaging
platforms to facilitate efficient data extraction, archiving and sharing
through the TTSH Central Biobank to support research involving clinical
samples.</p>
<p>Dr. Tan is also involved in mentorship programs to foster local research
talent, while also providing support for investigator-initiated studies.</p>
