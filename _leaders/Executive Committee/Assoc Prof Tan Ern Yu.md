**Profile**

* * *

Associate Professor Tan Ern Yu is a senior consultant breast surgeon at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). In addition to her clinical role, she serves as the Director of Clinical Research, Head of the Breast Service, and Director of the Breast Clinic. She completed her Doctor of Philosophy studies at the University of Oxford in 2005.

Dr Tan is actively engaged in research focused on translatable clinical outcomes. Her extensive research endeavors have involved collaborations with various esteemed local and international institutes such as the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB) where she has a joint appointment, as well as the Genome Institute of Singapore, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, National Cancer Center Tokyo, Cleveland Clinic, and several other international units through the Singapore Breast Cancer Working Group.

Dr Tan’s primary research interest lies in biomarker discovery, with a focus on blood-based DNA and microRNA markers that could serve as potential cancer markers. One notable collaboration involves working with IMCB and Indivumed to establish the world’s pioneering Asian-centric multi-omics database. Complementing her research pursuits, she actively explores advancements in breast imaging alongside breast radiologists. These collaborative efforts aim to optimize the use of breast imaging in diagnosing and managing various breast conditions. Notably, they are engaged in ongoing projects centered around contrast-enhanced spectral mammography and the development and training of artificial intelligence algorithms for mammography and breast ultrasound. These initiatives are conducted in partnership with industry experts.&nbsp;Dr. Tan is enthusiastic about expanding these research endeavors to support the broader research community in her capacity as the Director of Clinical Research at TTSH. She is leading the efforts to set up data and imaging platforms to facilitate efficient data extraction, archiving and sharing through the TTSH Central Biobank to support research involving clinical samples.

Dr. Tan is also involved in mentorship programs to foster local research talent, while also providing support for investigator-initiated studies.
