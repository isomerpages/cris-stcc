Dr Alexander Lezhava assumed the appointment as Group Leader, in the Translational Research group 1 (TR1), at the Genome Institute of Singapore, in August 2013. As a Senior Group Leader, Dr Lezhava, leads TR1 in promoting the smooth transition from basic research to advances in science and technology, and hence to innovation. Mainly focusing on molecular diagnostics, the mission of TR1 is to provide and market molecular diagnostic discoveries aligned with the industry needs and further develop these together with commercial partners. 

Dr Lezhava also holds a concurrent appointment as the Program Director of POLARIS (Transforming Disease Management through Personalised Profiling) program since October 2016. He has actively pushed POLARIS to new heights in RIE2020. His key missions are for POLARIS to maintain its CAP accreditation on top of forging closer links with genomic initiatives at A\*STAR as well as industry partners. POLARIS has become a supportive platform for clinical decision-making through molecular genomics. It has gradually evolved and is currently fully capable to serve a clinical community across Singapore and SEA region. In addition, Dr Lezhava serves the institute as a Management Representative for ISO accredited research groups for several years. Under his leadership, both TR1 and the New Generation Sequencing groups achieved ISO 13485 accreditation since 2015. This now has further expand with 2 additional research groups. 

In response to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, A\*STAR was commissioned for a central testing facility, where Dr Lezhava undertook the critical role of Laboratory Director of Stronghold Diagnostic Lab.

Dr Lezhava’s research interest is in Translational research, Molecular Diagnostics, Genomics technology development and he has published as many as 54 research papers, holds 4 patents and 11 technical disclosures. For his outstanding contributions to research, Dr Lezhava has received the Suzuken Memorial Foundation award in 2007 and Letter of Appreciation from President of RIKEN in 2009. 

Dr Lezhava graduated with a PhD from the Hiroshima University, Faculty of Engineering, Department of Fermentation Technology and Master of Science from Tbilisi State University, Faculty of Biology, Department of Genetics, in 1996 and 1990 respectively. His philosophy is “Professionalism of the Group is a key for successful activities”. As a group leader and a Program Director, his task is to attract motivated individuals with a strong background from both, industry and academia.
