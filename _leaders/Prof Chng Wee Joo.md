Profess Chng Wee Joo is the Executive Director of the Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium. He obtained his medical degree from the University of Leeds, UK, and did his internal medicine residency in the United Kingdom. He completed his Fellowship training in haematology in Singapore before he obtained an A\*STAR international fellowship in 2004 to go to the Mayo Clinic for a research fellowship in multiple myeloma genetics. 

He is a member of many international professional committees, such as American Society of Haematology Scientific Committee on Plasma Cell Neoplasia, the International Myeloma Working Group and the Asian Myeloma Network. He is also involved in a number of Grant Review Committees, Conference Organising Committee, Advisory Boards and Steering Committees of Global Clinical Trials. He has authored more than 200 publications in many reputed journals, and actively participates in clinical trials and has delivered talks in many national and international conferences.

Professor Chng’s current research is very translational and involves the use of high-resolution global genomic technique to understand biology, identify drug targets, understand drug resistance and improve disease prognosis in haematological malignancies, with the aim of improving patient’s outcome and personalizing treatment.
