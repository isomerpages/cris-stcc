**Profile** 

* * *

As both surgeon and health services researcher, Ker Kan’s primary research interests span the entire spectrum of the colorectal cancer journey – from screening and prevention, to diagnosis and treatment, and the experiences of specific subpopulations such as those with stoma or metastatic disease. His ongoing projects involve a broad range of key topics. These include understanding barriers and facilitators to colorectal screening, longitudinal quality-of-life of patients and spouses as they experience the treatment process. Apart from colorectal cancer, Ker Kan’s interests also extend to the use of telemedicine and other new models of care in health promotion and health services delivery.
